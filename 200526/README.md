# Exercise

Add support for an additional operation, "med" to the switch (todayâ€™s index.js) 
which calculates the [Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) number in the set.
To calculate the median you will have to follow the steps below:
1. Sort the set of numbers
2. Get the index of the middle number by dividing the last index of the set by two: \<last index> / 2
3. If the resulting index is a whole number (e.g. 7) then the median of the set is the value in that index.
4. Otherwise (if num is a fraction, e.g. 7.5) then the median is calculated
by adding the two values in the indexes around it (for 7.5 it would be 7, and 8 ) and dividing them by two.
